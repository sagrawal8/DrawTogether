## Repository Organization

2. There are no more individual assignments.
3. You will complete your [final project](./FinalProject) in the [final project](./FinalProject) directory. The organization is partially up to you on the file structure and organization, just make sure you organize it logically and against any requirements.

- Your project manager will be your first point of contact for various project deliverables and questions. Though you may continue to attend office hours with whoever you like, your project manager will be your primary contact.

## Team Logistics

- Work with your team to ensure everyone has a way to work on this codebase with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)
- See the project timeline
